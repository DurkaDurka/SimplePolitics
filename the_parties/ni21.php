				<p>NI21 is a political party in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 2013 by ex-Ulster Unionist Party MLAs Basil McCrea and John McCallister and holds two seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Although it supports Northern Ireland staying part of the United Kingdom (i.e. unionism), it rejects the term "unionist" due to its connotations. It presents itself as a "cross-community party" and promotes a "Northern Irish" national identity.</p>

			<h3>Manifesto</h3>

                <p><u><strong>HEALTH</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Abortion:</strong></p>

                	<p>NI21 believe women with unplanned pregnancies deserve the best possible access to information, advice and support. There may be some circumstances where an abortion is appropriate but that is for medical practitioners to decide. If we want to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies we need better education and access to appropriate contraception.</p>
                </ul>

                <p><u><strong>EDUCATION</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                        <p><strong>Aspire to better Education:</strong></p>

                        <li>Recognise that Ethos education is a core aspect of our education system; that schools with a clear ethos perform better; acknowledge that ethos education can come in many forms which have Catholic, Protestant, Integrated and even secular foundations, and that all should be valued.</li><br>

                        <li>Challenge Ethos schools to become more open and welcoming to children from different backgrounds – primarily ensuring more schools with a Catholic ethos become welcoming to Protestant families and more Protestant ethos schools become welcoming to Catholic families. Better integration within ethos schools is the best way to retain the best aspects of our education system whilst promoting a common future – normalising our society. Facilitating such a change will require significant leadership from our politicians and church leaders, it will also require a long-term plan to ensure we live in less segregated communities.</li> <br>

                        <li>Call on church leaders to produce a common shared education strategy.</li><br> 

                        <li>Call on the new Councils to produce a shared education strategy for their local areas.</li><br>

                        <li>Ensure that the long awaited Education and Skills Authority and the Curriculum both provide schools and their Boards of Governors with more flexibility to specialise in given subjects and manage their own affairs. Ensuring they are able to become high performing schools and that our school system is producing graduates with the right skills to get jobs in the economy of the 21st Century.</li><br>

                        <li>Using the new powers being devolved to local Government to better link careers advice, business needs, school specialisms and the needs of the Northern Ireland economy.</li><br>

                        <li>Recognising that parents have the right to retain academic selection at age 11, however, acknowledging that the best way to do away with academic selection and take the fear out of transfer is to break down segregation in our education system and to allow schools to specialise; meeting parents’ aspirations by universally higher performance levels.</li><br>

                        <li> Invest in early year’s education by delivering a pupil premium in years one to three which could see £900 of new money following each child from a disadvantaged background.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>John McCallister welcomes shared education:</strong></p>

                	<p> John McCallister, MLA, deputy leader of NI21 has welcomed the Minister for Education’s announcement on shared education describing it as a largely sensible and organic approach to a complex issue.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Ending Segregated Education:</strong></p>

                	<p>hat would a bold vision for shared education look like? The Programme for Government of the next Executive should publicly declare that division in our education system will not continue; that a new shared approach to education must be put in place over the next decade; and that by 2025 every child and young person's experience of primary and post-primary education will be shared with children and young people from across the community. I began with the figure of 68%. I'll end with another figure, very close to it. 63% - that's the proportion of people in Northern Ireland who believe our current education system perpetuates divisions in our society. If we want a shared, reconciled Northern Ireland, the Executive has to radically address the 'separate but equal' approach to education.</p>
                </ul>

                <p><u><strong>ECONOMY</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                	<li>NI21 is therefore committed to engendering a greater consensus in Northern Ireland that business is essential to developing a successful society; Government has a responsibility for the development of the economy and the private sector has a responsibility to help develop a fair and flourishing region.</li><br>

                        <li>Pursuing the devolution of more fiscal powers into a reforming Northern Ireland Assembly; including income tax and stamp duty - boosting our capabilities in the future to meet our specific economic and social needs and to manage volatility in our local property market;Calling upon the UK Government to set up a full Commission to provide detailed examination of how additional powers might be devolved.</li><br>

                        <li>Ensuring such a Commission goes further than the Calman and Silk Commissions; in order to boost targeted investment in Research and Development and production capabilities, it should examine the devolution of powers over capital allowances.</li><br>

                        <li>Ensuring such a Commission examines the power to set personal tax allowances in Northern Ireland that best suit our low wage economy, and boost demand in our internal markets.</li><br>

                        <li>Ensuring a higher standard of regional economic data is produced by the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Treasury; guaranteeing current, and any enhanced economic powers, can be used in the most informed and proficient way.</li><br>

                        <li>Working with UK financial regulators to ensure banks operating in Northern Ireland share more regionalised statistics with the Northern Ireland Government and Assembly specifically concerning bank lending for SMEs.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <p><u><strong>SOCIAL ISSUES</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Sexual Orientation Strategy:</strong></p>

                	<p>NI21 is committed to supporting individuals within the LGBT community to ensure they are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Equal Marriage:</strong></p>

                	<p>Ni21 is a party for all and will not discriminate on any basis and fully supports equal marriage.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Free Speech:</strong></p>

                	<p>NI21 believes in freedom of speech.Freedom of speech increases transparency, accountability and participation and it is a cornerstone of democracy.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Human Trafficking:</strong></p>

                	<p>NI21 is against Lord Morrow’s Private Members Bill, Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Further Provisions and Support for Victims) Bill, as it is an example of poor legislation.</p>
                </ul>

                <p><u><strong>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Local Government Bill:</strong></p>

                	<p>NI21 believe the Local Government Bill is in danger of devolving the Assembly’s dysfunctionality to new local councils. NI21 firmly believes that we have to get the Northern Ireland Assembly working properly before we start building local government in its image.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Reform of the Assembley:</strong></p>

                	<li>Ensuring political parties agree a Programme for Government prior to entering into the Executive; developing collective responsibility and Government by single mandate; </li><br>
                        <li>Renaming the Office of the First and deputy First Minister the Office of Joint First Ministers, removing one of the most divisive tenants of our elections; forcing the DUP and Sinn Fein to seek votes based on policies and not a tribal headcount; </li><br>
                        <li>Electing the Speaker by a secret ballot, and elevating him or her to be the MLA for Stormont, ensuring that the Northern Ireland Assembly is empowered to stand up to the Executive; </li><br>
                        <li>Reforming the Assembly Committee system to ensure that opposition parties are adequately represented as Committee Chairs; in particular ensuring the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee is a member of the Opposition; </li><br>
                        <li>Reforming the Northern Ireland Assembly Finance Committee to ensure it scrutinises the financial memorandum and planning of all legislation deriving from each Government Department; enhancing the competence of Government financial planning and transparency.</li><br>
                        
                </ul>

                <p><u><strong>PAST-PARADES-FLAGS</strong></u></p>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Flags:</strong></p>

                	<li>NI21 believes that all political parties should make a commitment to develop the circumstances where communities feel empowered to remove permanent flags and illegal emblems from public spaces throughout Northern Ireland.</li><br>

                        <li>NI21 believes the Union Flag should be flown on designated days on Government Buildings.</li><br>

                        <li>NI21 believes the Union Flag should be flown on main council buildings on designated days.</li><br>

                        <li>NI21 believes that the removal of permanent flags and paramilitary emblems will help communities develop.</li><br>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>The Past:</strong></p>

                	<p>While ensuring that victims receive the support and resources they need,  NI21 firmly believes that we must make progress in governing the present and building a future. The focus must be on a cohesive, productive and successful Northern Ireland NI21 has backed the proposal by the Attorney General to bring an end to the prospect of inquests with respect to Troubles-related deaths. 1998 was a pivotal moment in our history when most expected a political line to be drawn under the past.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Northern Irish Identity:</strong></p>

                	<p>the failure to espouse and promote a shared Northern Ireland identity. Northern Ireland needs a sense of ‘We’ to replace ‘Them and Us’. NI21 believes there is need to address a gap in the emotional architecture of the Good Friday Agreement. In the absence of such a shared identity, the emotional ‘pull’ of ‘Them and Us’ politics will almost certainly be stronger and more compelling than that of a progressive politics which flees from any sense of identity.A shared Northern Ireland identity – with appropriate symbols – is not an artificial product, the result of abstract social engineering.</p>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                	<p><strong>Parades:</strong></p>

                	<li>Northern Ireland needs to find a solution to contentious parades to allow politics and society to move on and focus on more pressing social and economic issues.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 respects and supports the rights of people to parade, and protest. However, we also believe that these rights must be balanced with the rights of others in our community to go about their daily lives, to be free from harassment or intimidation and to feel safe. NI21 believes that those who organise parades or protests, who bring people onto the streets, have a duty to the rest of society to ensure violence does not occur. We have to move away from the zero sum mentality which suggests that the right to parade, or the ability to stop a parade, is she summation of any culture, sense of identity or political aspiration.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21’s vision is a future where people parade to celebrate and not to offend, where people do not go out of their way to be offended and where people who do not associate with any type of parading can get on with their daily lives. The vast majority of parading in Northern Ireland already meets this vision, however, we must find a resolution to contentious parades.</li><br>
                        <li>In the longer term we must work towards resolving contentious parades through local dialogue, building relationships and understanding. In the short term NI21 believes contentious parades are not going to go away. This means Northern Ireland needs an accepted independent body to adjudicate upon them. Currently the decisions of the Parades Commission are routinely questioned and undermined by politicians and members of civil society. This in turn undermines and questions the rule of law and those entrusted to uphold it. Such a situation not only provokes unrest but is bad for the future of our democracy.</li><br>
                        <li>In order to avoid future violence, to promote respect for the rule of law and those entrusted to uphold it, NI21 believes that the legislative authority for the process of mediating and adjudicating on contentious parades and protests should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Local politicians must take responsibility for parading and begin to manage interested groups’ expectations.A new parading body</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that any new parades body will face the same dilemmas and difficulties as the current Parades Commission. It will by necessity resemble the current Parades Commission and interested groups expectations need to be managed accordingly. NI21 believes that the legislative authority for the process of mediating and adjudicating on contentious parades and protests should be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. NI21 is against direct intervention in any mediation or adjudication process by elected representatives, however, local politicians must show greater respect for the rule of law and have greater ownership and responsibility for any independent body created to oversee parading. Devolving the legislation to constitute such an independent body will make it more difficult for local Government Ministers and politicians to dangerously wash their hands of any future adjudicating body’s decisions. This will lead to more stable resolutions and politics in the future.</li><br>
                        <li>In light of its joint status and position at the centre for Government, NI21 believes that the Office of the First and deputy First Minister is the most appropriate Government Department to take responsibility for devolved legislation.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are important rights to be enjoyed by all people in Northern Ireland.</li><br>

                        <li>NI21 believes that the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are important rights to be enjoyed by all people in Northern Ireland.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 respects and supports the rights of all people in Northern Ireland to express their cultural heritage and identity.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 respects and supports the rights of all people in Northern Ireland to be free from harassment and intimidation.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that organisers of parades and protests have a duty to society to ensure their parades or protests remain peaceful.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that public highways in Northern Ireland are shared spaces which should, within reason, be utilised by all people in Northern Ireland ; NI21 rejects the explicit or implicit demarcation of streets or areas as belonging to any one community.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that political leadership, dialogue and the building of mutual respect and understanding are the primary ways to reduce the number of contentious parades and protests.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that one of the main pillars of democratic societies is respect for the democratically constituted rule of law.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 believes that those tasked with policing the rule of law should be supported by political leaders and members of Government.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 supports the Parades Commission as it carries out its work under the mandate it has been given in the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998.</li><br>
                        <li>NI21 fully supports the PSNI in upholding the rule of law and upholding Parade Commission rulings.</li><br>
