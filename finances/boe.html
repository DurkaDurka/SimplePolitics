	<p>Originally established as a privately-owned institution, the Bank of England was nationalised after the Second World War, but retained its broad – but largely informal – "public service mission". This changed in 1997, when Parliament voted to give the Bank operational independence with a clear remit to pursue price stability, which had been the most significant challenge facing macroeconomic policymaking for the previous two decades.<br>
	There are 2 major factors that contribute to inflation; the first is called Quantative Easing, where the Bank of England prints money and sells it to the government, which then uses it to boost the economy. And the second is when ordinary banks (such as Lloyds and HSBC) create money out of thin air. This happens everytime someone takes out a loan, such as a business loan or mortgage.</p>

	<p>The bank doesn't actually have this money to give, instead it borrows the money from the bank of England (which has to print the money) at a cheap rate and sells it on to you, the customer. With more money circulating the value of £1 reduces, and therefore prices go up. This "legalised" counterfieting of money by the banks leads to the boom bust cycle we see with the current financial system; when confidence is lost and there is no longer a mad dash for loans and high levels of spending people start repaying there debts and spending less. This leads to a reduction of money in circulation, as money repaid ends up back at the bank of england and is destroyed, taking it out of circulation. This generally causes deflation as the value of each £1 increases again causing a reduction in prices. Deflation <u>can</u> be a bad thing as it can cause an economy to stagnate, negatively effecting the number of jobs and peoples wages. The Bank of England attempts to counter act this by....you guessed it, printing more money - ad infinitum totalis fuckedarpis.</p>
